Plant Place is a frontend catalog where you can browse and buy plants. I got to dive into this project as part of a React challenge, one of three I've tackled so far. These challenges were all about building specific features to meet the project's needs.

For Plant Place, I used React to build the whole user interface. I also played around with CSS to make it look tranquil and minimal, giving users a zen-like browsing experience. 

My main goal here was to sharpen my React and CSS skills. I used React Router to help users navigate smoothly through the app and keep the URL up to date. Plus, I added React Paginate to make the user experience smooth. 

Behind the scenes, I used tech like React, React Hooks, React Router, React Paginate, Local Storage, CSS, and HTML to make Plant Place a pleasant spot for plant lovers.ðŸŒ±ðŸ›’
